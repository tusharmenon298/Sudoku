# <u> *Sudoku Generator and Solver* </u>


*Sudoku is a puzzle in which players insert the numbers one to nine into a grid consisting of nine squares subdivided into a further nine smaller squares in such a way that every number appears once in each horizontal line, vertical line, and square.*

What I am trying to do here is create a sudoku creator using different programming languages and also create a program to solve them.


Right now, I have only done a python version, because it was easier to code.


But I am also working on a Java version too right now.



<h6> Will add more language versions later </h6>
